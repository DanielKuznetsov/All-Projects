          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were

          looking to make a transition and nave heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up TO the tree intro course and
          round it incredibly run! I enrolled shortly thereatter. The next 12
          weeks were the best - and most grueling - time of my life. SInce

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
